## Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors. We expect everyone to adhere to professional standards of conduct which include being respectful of diverse viewpoints and experiences, using inclusive and appropriate language, and providing constructive feedback. Any form of harassment, discriminatory language, or personal attacks will not be tolerated. This commitment extends to all project interactions, including issue tracking, updates, and pull requests.

## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/ionStici/age-calculator-app-fem/issues).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

A good bug report involves collecting enough information about the problem, then describing the issue in detail in your report.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/ionStici/age-calculator-app-fem/issues).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ionStici/age-calculator-app-fem/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.

## Attribution

This guide is based on the **contributing.md**. [Make your own](https://contributing.md/)!
